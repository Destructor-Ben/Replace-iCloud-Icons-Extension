# Replace iCloud Icons
A basic chrome extension to improve the icons on the iCloud website by replacing them with the app icons.

I had to rip and deobfuscate a bit of code from the iCloud website to make dynamic calendar icons, so please don't sue me Apple <3.

The code of this repo is MIT licensed, but the icons belong to Apple, not me.

No published extension yet because I would have to pay money.
